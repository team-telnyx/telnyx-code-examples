# Build a Smart IVR A/B Tester

Smart IVR A/B Tester — run two IVR flows simultaneously and track which converts better.

## How It Works

## Telnyx Products Used

- **Migration**
- **Number Porting** — phone number search, purchase, and configuration
- **Voice** — programmatic call control with webhooks for every call state change

## API Endpoints

- **Call Control: Answer**: `POST /v2/calls/{id}/actions/answer` — [API reference](https://developers.telnyx.com/api/call-control/answer-call)
- **Call Control: Speak (TTS)**: `POST /v2/calls/{id}/actions/speak` — [API reference](https://developers.telnyx.com/api/call-control/speak)
- **Call Control: Gather (STT/DTMF)**: `POST /v2/calls/{id}/actions/gather_using_speak` — [API reference](https://developers.telnyx.com/api/call-control/gather)

## Webhook Events

Telnyx uses webhooks for call control — you don't poll for state. Each event tells you what happened, and your response tells Telnyx what to do next.

This app handles these webhook events ([Call Control docs](https://developers.telnyx.com/docs/api/v2/call-control)):
- `call.answered` — Call connected — app begins interaction
- `call.gather.ended` — Caller input received (speech transcription or DTMF digits)
- `call.hangup` — Call ended — app cleans up session, triggers post-call processing
- `call.initiated` — New inbound or outbound call detected
- `call.speak.ended` — TTS playback finished — app transitions to next action (gather, transfer, etc.)

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- [Telnyx account](https://portal.telnyx.com/sign-up) with funded balance
- [API key](https://portal.telnyx.com/api-keys)
- [Phone number](https://portal.telnyx.com/numbers/my-numbers) with voice enabled
- [Call Control Application](https://portal.telnyx.com/call-control/applications) configured with your webhook URL
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) for exposing your local server to Telnyx webhooks

## Step 1: Set Up the Project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/team-telnyx/telnyx-code-examples.git
cd telnyx-code-examples/smart-ivr-ab-tester-python
cp .env.example .env
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Edit `.env` with your Telnyx credentials. Each variable links to where you find it in the [Telnyx Portal](https://portal.telnyx.com).

## Step 2: Understand the Code

Everything lives in `app.py` (90 lines). Here's what each piece does.

### Starting the Workflow

**`create_experiment()`** — Kicks off the main workflow. Validates the request, creates the record, and initiates the Telnyx API calls.

```python
data = request.get_json()
    eid = f"EXP-{int(time.time())}"
    experiments[eid] = {"variant_a": data.get("variant_a", {}), "variant_b": data.get("variant_b", {}),
        "traffic_split": data.get("split", 0.5), "results": {"a": {"calls": 0, "connected": 0, "hangups": 0}, "b": {"calls": 0, "connected": 0, "hangups": 0}}}
    return jsonify({"experiment_id": eid}), 200
@app.route("/webhooks/voice", methods=["POST"])
```

### Handling Webhooks

This is the core of the app — a state machine driven by Telnyx webhook events. Each event triggers the next step:

**`handle_voice()`** — The voice webhook handler — the core state machine. Each Telnyx event triggers the next action in the call flow.

### Business Logic

- **`get_results()`** — Handles the get results logic.

### All Endpoints

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `POST` | `/experiments` | Create Experiment |
| `POST` | `/webhooks/voice` | Telnyx webhook handler |
| `GET` | `/experiments/<eid>/results` | Get Results |
| `GET` | `/health` | Health check |

## Step 3: Run It

```bash
python app.py
```

Server starts on `http://localhost:5000`.

In a separate terminal, expose your server for webhooks:

```bash
ngrok http 5000
```

Copy the HTTPS URL and set it in the [Telnyx Portal](https://portal.telnyx.com):

- **Call Control Application** → Webhook URL → `https://<id>.ngrok.io/webhooks/voice`

## Step 4: Test It

**Health check:**

```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/health
```

**Trigger the workflow:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/experiments \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "phone": "+12125559999"
  }'
```

Or call your Telnyx number from any phone to trigger the full voice workflow.

**Check results:**

```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/experiments/<eid>/results | python3 -m json.tool
```

## Going to Production

This example uses in-memory storage for simplicity. For production:

- **Database** — replace the in-memory dict/list with PostgreSQL or Redis
- **Authentication** — add API key validation on your endpoints
- **Webhook verification** — validate Telnyx webhook signatures ([docs](https://developers.telnyx.com/docs/api/v2/overview#webhook-signing))
- **Error recovery** — handle call failures gracefully with retry or SMS fallback
- **Monitoring** — add structured logging and health check alerts
- **Rate limiting** — protect your endpoints from abuse

## Deploy

```bash
# Docker
docker build -t smart-ivr-ab-tester-python .
docker run --env-file .env -p 5000:5000 smart-ivr-ab-tester-python

# Or Makefile
make setup && make run
```
