# Build a Warm Transfer with AI Briefing

When an agent transfers a call, AI summarizes the conversation and briefs the next agent before connecting. No cold handoffs.

## How It Works

```
Inbound/Outbound Call
        │
        ▼
  Call Answered ──► TTS Greeting
        │
        ▼
  Gather Input ──► AI Inference
  (speech/DTMF)    (process + decide)
        │
        ▼
  Take Action ──► SMS Notification
  (speak/transfer)
        │
        ▼
  Call Ends ──► Log & Notify
```

## Telnyx Products Used

- **Voice** — programmatic call control with webhooks for every call state change
- **AI Inference** — LLM inference with OpenAI-compatible API, runs on Telnyx infrastructure
- **Conferencing**

## API Endpoints

- **AI Inference**: `POST /v2/ai/chat/completions` — [API reference](https://developers.telnyx.com/api/inference/chat-completions)

## Webhook Events

Telnyx uses webhooks for call control — you don't poll for state. Each event tells you what happened, and your response tells Telnyx what to do next.

This app handles these webhook events ([Call Control docs](https://developers.telnyx.com/docs/api/v2/call-control)):
- `call.answered` — Call connected — app begins interaction
- `call.gather.ended` — Caller input received (speech transcription or DTMF digits)
- `call.hangup` — Call ended — app cleans up session, triggers post-call processing
- `call.initiated` — New inbound or outbound call detected

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- [Telnyx account](https://portal.telnyx.com/sign-up) with funded balance
- [API key](https://portal.telnyx.com/api-keys)
- [Phone number](https://portal.telnyx.com/numbers/my-numbers) with voice enabled
- [Call Control Application](https://portal.telnyx.com/call-control/applications) configured with your webhook URL
- [Slack incoming webhook](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks) (optional)
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) for exposing your local server to Telnyx webhooks

## Step 1: Set Up the Project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/team-telnyx/telnyx-code-examples.git
cd telnyx-code-examples/warm-transfer-ai-briefing-python
cp .env.example .env
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Edit `.env` with your Telnyx credentials. Each variable links to where you find it in the [Telnyx Portal](https://portal.telnyx.com).

## Step 2: Understand the Code

Everything lives in `app.py` (209 lines). Here's what each piece does.

### Starting the Workflow

**`initiate_transfer()`** — Transfers the active call to another party — a human agent, specialist, or external number.

```python
    data = request.get_json() or {}
    original_call_id = data.get("call_id")
    next_agent_phone = data.get("next_agent")
    reason = data.get("reason", "")
    call = calls.get(original_call_id)
    if not call:
        return jsonify({"error": "call not found"}), 404
    # Generate AI briefing from conversation so far
```

### Handling Webhooks

This is the core of the app — a state machine driven by Telnyx webhook events. Each event triggers the next step:

**`handle_voice()`** — The voice webhook handler — the core state machine. Each Telnyx event triggers the next action in the call flow.

- `call.initiated` → call setup in progress
- `call.answered` → greet the caller with TTS
- `call.gather.ended` → process the caller's response
- `call.hangup` → clean up and log

### Helper Functions

- **`call_inference()`** — Sends conversation context to Telnyx AI Inference and returns the model's response. Uses the OpenAI-compatible chat completions endpoint.

### Business Logic

- **`telnyx_post()`** — Makes an API call and processes the response.
- **`list_transfers()`** — Transfers the active call to another party — a human agent, specialist, or external number.
- **`list_calls()`** — Handles the list calls logic.

### All Endpoints

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `POST` | `/webhooks/voice` | Telnyx webhook handler |
| `POST` | `/transfers/initiate` | Initiate Transfer |
| `GET` | `/transfers` | List Transfers |
| `GET` | `/calls` | List Calls |
| `GET` | `/health` | Health check |

## Step 3: Run It

```bash
python app.py
```

Server starts on `http://localhost:5000`.

In a separate terminal, expose your server for webhooks:

```bash
ngrok http 5000
```

Copy the HTTPS URL and set it in the [Telnyx Portal](https://portal.telnyx.com):

- **Call Control Application** → Webhook URL → `https://<id>.ngrok.io/webhooks/voice`

## Step 4: Test It

**Health check:**

```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/health
```

**Trigger the workflow:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/transfers/initiate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "phone": "+12125559999"
  }'
```

Or call your Telnyx number from any phone to trigger the full voice workflow.

**Check results:**

```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/transfers | python3 -m json.tool
```

## Going to Production

This example uses in-memory storage for simplicity. For production:

- **Database** — replace the in-memory dict/list with PostgreSQL or Redis
- **Authentication** — add API key validation on your endpoints
- **Webhook verification** — validate Telnyx webhook signatures ([docs](https://developers.telnyx.com/docs/api/v2/overview#webhook-signing))
- **Error recovery** — handle call failures gracefully with retry or SMS fallback
- **Prompt engineering** — tune the AI prompts for your specific domain and tone
- **Monitoring** — add structured logging and health check alerts
- **Rate limiting** — protect your endpoints from abuse

## Deploy

```bash
# Docker
docker build -t warm-transfer-ai-briefing-python .
docker run --env-file .env -p 5000:5000 warm-transfer-ai-briefing-python

# Or Makefile
make setup && make run
```
