# Text To Speech with Node.js and Express

## What Does This Example Do?

Build a production-ready Express endpoint that plays text-to-speech (TTS) messages during active voice calls using the Telnyx Voice API. This tutorial demonstrates the new client-based initialization pattern, proper handling of call control commands, webhook event processing, and secure credential management via environment variables.

## Who Is This For?

- **Node.js developers** building voice features with Express.
- **Backend engineers** integrating telephony or messaging into existing applications.
- **DevOps teams** looking for containerized, production-ready telecom examples.
- **Startups and enterprises** replacing legacy telecom providers with a modern API-first platform.

## Why Telnyx?

Telnyx is an **AI Communications Infrastructure** platform that gives developers a single API for [voice](https://telnyx.com/products/voice-ai-agents), [messaging](https://telnyx.com/products/sms-api), [SIP](https://telnyx.com/products/sip-trunks), [AI](https://telnyx.com/ai-assistants), and [IoT](https://telnyx.com/products/iot-sim-card) — no Frankenstack required.

- **Integrated platform** — [Voice](https://telnyx.com/products/voice-ai-agents), [SMS](https://telnyx.com/products/sms-api), [SIP trunking](https://telnyx.com/products/sip-trunks), [AI assistants](https://telnyx.com/ai-assistants), and [IoT SIM management](https://telnyx.com/products/iot-sim-card) under one roof. No stitching together multiple vendors.
- **Global private network** — Calls and messages traverse the Telnyx-owned IP network for lower latency and higher reliability than the public internet.
- **Developer-first** — SDKs for Python, Node.js, Go, Ruby, Java, and PHP. Comprehensive webhook event model. Sandbox environment for testing.
- **Competitive pricing** — Pay-as-you-go with no minimums, contracts, or per-seat fees.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 14 or higher.
- A Telnyx account with an active API key from the [Telnyx Portal](https://portal.telnyx.com).
- A Telnyx phone number enabled for outbound calls.
- A Call Control Application configured in the Telnyx Portal with a connection ID.
- npm (Node package manager).
- A publicly accessible URL for receiving webhooks (ngrok or similar for local development).

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Local (recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/team-telnyx/telnyx-code-examples.git
cd telnyx-code-examples/text-to-speech-phone-call-nodejs
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Telnyx API key and phone number
make setup
make run
```

### Option 2: Docker

```bash
git clone https://github.com/team-telnyx/telnyx-code-examples.git
cd telnyx-code-examples/text-to-speech-phone-call-nodejs
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your credentials
make docker-build
make docker-run
```

### Option 3: Manual

See the [Implementation Details](#implementation-details) section below for step-by-step instructions.

## Implementation Details

Create `app.js` and initialize the Telnyx client using the new pattern. Define helper functions to handle call initiation and TTS playback with proper validation:

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");
const Telnyx = require("telnyx");
require("dotenv").config();

const app = express();
app.use(bodyParser.json());

// Initialize client with the new SDK pattern
const client = new Telnyx({ apiKey: process.env.TELNYX_API_KEY });

/**
 * Initiate an outbound call and prepare for TTS playback.
 * Returns call_control_id for subsequent control actions.
 */
async function initiateCall(toNumber) {
  const fromNumber = process.env.TELNYX_PHONE_NUMBER;
  const connectionId = process.env.TELNYX_CONNECTION_ID;

  if (!fromNumber) {
    throw new Error("TELNYX_PHONE_NUMBER environment variable not set");
  }
  if (!connectionId) {
    throw new Error("TELNYX_CONNECTION_ID environment variable not set");
  }

  // Validate E.164 format to prevent API errors
  if (!toNumber.startsWith("+")) {
    throw new Error(
      "Phone number must be in E.164 format (e.g., +15551234567)"
    );
  }

  // Initiate the call using client.calls.dial()
  const response = await client.calls.dial({
    from_: fromNumber,
    to: toNumber,
    connection_id: connectionId,
  });

  // Extract serializable data — SDK objects are NOT JSON-serializable
  return {
    call_control_id: response.data.call_control_id,
    from: fromNumber,
    to: toNumber,
  };
}

/**
 * Play text-to-speech message on an active call.
 * Requires call_control_id from an initiated or answered call.
 */
async function playTTS(callControlId, message, language = "en-US") {
  if (!callControlId) {
    throw new Error("call_control_id is required to play TTS");
  }

  // Use client.calls.actions.speak() to play TTS
  const response = await client.calls.actions.speak(callControlId, {
    payload: message,
    language: language,
    voice: "female",
  });

  // Extract serializable data
  return {
    call_control_id: response.data.call_control_id,
    status: response.data.status,
  };
}

module.exports = { initiateCall, playTTS, client };
```

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Problem | Solution |
|-------|---------|----------|
| Authentication Error (401) | The endpoint returns `{"error": "Invalid API key"}` with HTTP 401. | Verify your `TELNYX_API_KEY` in the `.env` file matches the key shown in the [Telnyx Portal](https://portal.telnyx.com). Ensure there are no trailing spaces or quotes. If the key was regenerated recently, update your environment file and restart the Node.js server. |
| Invalid Phone Number Format | You receive a 400 error stating "Phone number must be in E.164 format" or a Telnyx API error about invalid destination. | Ensure all phone numbers use E.164 format: start with `+`, followed by country code and number without spaces or dashes. Example: `+15551234567` (US) or `+447700900123` (UK). Update your test curl command to use properly formatted numbers. |
| Connection ID Not Set | The application raises `Error: TELNYX_CONNECTION_ID environment variable not set` on the first call initiation. | Confirm your `.env` file exists in the same directory as `app.js` and contains the `TELNYX_CONNECTION_ID` variable. Retrieve your connection ID from the [Telnyx Portal](https://portal.telnyx.com) under Call Control Applications. Ensure the file is named exactly `.env` (not `.env.txt` or `env`). Restart the server after updating. |
| Webhook Not Receiving Events | The `/webhooks/call` endpoint is not being triggered when calls are answered. | Verify that the `WEBHOOK_URL` in your `.env` file is publicly accessible and matches the webhook URL configured in your Call Control Application settings in the Telnyx Portal. Use ngrok (`ngrok http 3000`) for local development and update the webhook URL to the ngrok-provided domain. Ensure your firewall allows inbound HTTPS traffic on port 443. |
| TTS Not Playing on Call | The call connects but no audio is heard, or the `/calls/:callControlId/speak` endpoint returns an error. | Confirm the `call_control_id` is correct and the call is in an active state (not on hold or already ended). Verify the `message` parameter is not empty and contains valid text. Check that your Telnyx account has TTS enabled. Review server logs for detailed error messages from the Telnyx API. |
